# Medical-Chatbot-with-AI-RAG-and-Semantic-Search
🩺 AI-Powered Medical Chatbot with Semantic Understanding 🤖
📘 Project Description
This project is a comprehensive implementation of an AI-based medical chatbot designed to respond to user health-related queries with high contextual accuracy. The chatbot understands the user's intent, processes natural language, and provides relevant medical responses using a combination of deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and semantic similarity search (extendable using FAISS). The final goal is to deploy it as a real-time interactive web application using Streamlit.


## 🧩 Key Components:

1. **Text Embeddings**  
   - Converts document content into vector format using a sentence-transformer model.
   - These vectors capture semantic meaning, not just keyword matches.

2. **Vector Store (FAISS)**  
   - Stores all the vectorized documents in a searchable format.
   - Enables efficient similarity search when a query is made.

3. **Document Retrieval**  
   - When a user submits a query, it's converted to a vector.
   - The system searches for the top `k` most similar document chunks using FAISS.

4. **Language Model (LLM)**  
   - A pre-trained language model (like Mistral-7B) from HuggingFace is used.
   - It takes the retrieved document chunks and generates a human-like answer to the user’s query.

5. **LangChain Pipeline**  
   - Orchestrates the entire flow: embedding, retrieval, passing context to LLM, and generating final output.
   - Custom prompts can be added to tailor the model's behavior or tone.
