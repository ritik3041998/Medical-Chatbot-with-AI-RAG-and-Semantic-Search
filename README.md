# Medical-Chatbot-with-AI-RAG-and-Semantic-Search
ðŸ©º AI-Powered Medical Chatbot with Semantic Understanding ðŸ¤–
ðŸ“˜ Project Description
This project is a comprehensive implementation of an AI-based medical chatbot designed to respond to user health-related queries with high contextual accuracy. The chatbot understands the user's intent, processes natural language, and provides relevant medical responses using a combination of deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and semantic similarity search (extendable using FAISS). The final goal is to deploy it as a real-time interactive web application using Streamlit.
